This PostgreSQL is from my labs from the module Databases 1 in Year 2 Semester 3 . This  database models a social media platform with four core tables designed to manage user interactions and content sharing.

## Table Structure

- **users**: Stores user account information and profile details
- **photos**: Contains user-uploaded images with references to their creators
- **likes**: Records user engagements with photos through likes
- **follow**: Manages follower/following relationships between users

## Features

- **Referential Integrity**: Comprehensive foreign key constraints maintain data consistency across all relationships
- **Pre-loaded Sample Data**: Includes initial dataset for immediate testing and demonstration
- **Analytical Queries**: Pre-built queries provide insights into user engagement, popularity metrics, and social connections

## Functionality

The schema supports key social media features including:
- User registration and profile management
- Photo uploads and attribution
- Like/engagement tracking
- Follower/following relationship management
- Activity analysis and metrics reporting

## Usage

Ideal for developing social media applications that require robust data management for user interactions, content sharing, and relationship tracking while maintaining strict data integrity through relational constraints.
